Instructions
============
	
[1] Examine the contents of index.html, and play with it in a web browser.  There are five functions implemented in index.html using JavaScript and the jQuery library, functionA through functionE, which are used within the document's ready event handler.

[2] Add documentation to the JavaScript code.  Think about documenting the overall purpose of each of the functions, as well as to the lines within the functions.  The idea is to document enough of the JavaScript to show that you understand each part.  You may find the jQuery documentation (http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page) helpful if you haven't used it before.

[3] Add a checkbox to the web page, and have the alert dialog that pops up when you hit the "submit" button reflect the state of the checkbox (e.g. checked/unchecked, true/false, etc.).
