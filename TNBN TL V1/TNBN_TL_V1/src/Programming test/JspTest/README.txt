Instructions
============

Included is the source code for a skeleton Java Web Application with one JSP page and one Java back-end class.  Edit the JSP to take in a string of text input from the user, pass it through the Java class' processString method, and display the output.  You should not have to edit the Java file.

The project is bundled as a NetBeans project, but you are free to use whatever (or no) IDE you'd like.  Note that you will have to install a Java Enterprise container (e.g. Apache Tomcat 6 - http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi) to deploy the web application.
